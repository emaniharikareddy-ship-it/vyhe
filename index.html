    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920) was a self-taught Indian mathematical prodigy who made profound contributions to number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, despite having almost no formal training, discovering complex formulas through
        intuition and divine inspiration, leading to a fruitful collaboration with British mathematician G.H. Hardy at Cambridge before his tragically short life ended at age 32 due to ill health, leaving behind notebooks of formulas still studied today.
        Early Life & Discovery: Born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, Ramanujan displayed prodigious mathematical talent from a young age, mastering advanced concepts independently. He studied George Shoobridge Carr's "Synopsis of Elementary Results," which,
        lacking proofs, fueled his own innovative discoveries. He faced poverty and academic setbacks due to his singular focus on mathematics, failing non-math subjects. Collaboration with G.H. Hardy: In 1913, Ramanujan sent letters with his unique theorems
        to Cambridge mathematician G.H. Hardy, who recognized his genius and invited him to England. Their collaboration from 1914-1919 was highly productive, blending Ramanujan's intuitive genius with Hardy's rigor, leading to significant publications.
        Key Contributions & Recognition: Number Theory: Pioneered discoveries about the partition function. Infinite Series & Continued Fractions: Developed numerous formulas in these areas. The Ramanujan Number (1729): Famously identified 1729 as the
        smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. Honors: Became a Fellow of the Royal Society (1918) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1918). Later Life & Legacy: His health declined in England, likely due to diet and illness,
        and he returned to India in 1919. He died in 1920 at age 32, but his extensive notebooks continue to be studied, revealing formulas that have had lasting impacts on mathematics.
